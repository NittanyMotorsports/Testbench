## Introduction

This repository serves as the central hub for managing our testing and validation efforts. We will be using a Raspberry Pi 4 running Linux Ubuntu 22.04 as our testing machine. Slash will be our main testing framework.

## Folder Structure

- `/HIL`: Hardware in the Loop testbench
- `/SIL`: Software in the Loop testbench
- `*/docs`: Documentation related to testing procedures, data analysis, and results.

## Setup and Installation

We will be using an install sscript to automatically install all dependencies that the Raspberry Pi will need. Once this is operational, delete this and replace with step by step instructions.

## Testing Procedures

Detailed documentation on various testing procedures carried out on our Formula SAE electric vehicle. Include step-by-step instructions, safety precautions, and any special considerations. Put any test plans that you create in the respective `/test-plans` folder for the project you are working on.

## Data Analysis

Explain how data from testing is collected, processed, and analyzed. Include examples of data analysis scripts and tools used for interpreting results. Slash documents all data, so once everything is operation put the file path here.
